> [The search engine is no longer a model of human knowledge](https://www.edge.org/conversation/george_dyson-childhoods-end){:target="_blank"}, it is human knowledge. What began as a mapping of human meaning now defines human meaning, and has begun to control, rather than simply catalog or index, human thought. No one is at the controls. If enough drivers subscribe to a real-time map, traffic is controlled, with no central model except the traffic itself. The successful social network is no longer a model of the social graph, it is the social graph.

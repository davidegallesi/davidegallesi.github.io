I finally decided my planner and notebook setup for 2024. I will use a Hobonichi Weeks as I do sonce 2016. I decided to go for the Mega, it is slightly thicker than the standard one [[It is just 3mm thicker thtan the standard weeks but offers more than 200 pages at the end for free writings::rmn]]but has the double pages at the end. Like having an additional notebook. For daily journaling I normally use an A5 notebook, this year I have decided to go with the Hobonichi Weeks memo pad. They're 40 pages and made of the same Tomoe over paper the Weeks os done with. Sightly smaller can be fitted in the back of

I finally decided my planner and notebook setup for 2024. I will use a Hobonichi Weeks as I do sonce 2016. I decided to go for the Mega, it is slightly thicker than the standard one [[It is just 3mm thicker than the standard weeks ![Weeks Mega](/assets/postimg/weeks-mega.jpg) but offers more than 200 pages at the end for free writings while the standrd Weeks has 71 pages ::rmn]]but has the double pages at the end. Like having an additional notebook. For daily journaling I normally use an A5 notebook, this year I have decided to go with the Hobonichi Weeks memo pad. They're just 2mm thick with 40 pages made of the same Tomoe River paper from the Weeks os done with. Sightly smaller they're the perfect carry around with the Weeks.

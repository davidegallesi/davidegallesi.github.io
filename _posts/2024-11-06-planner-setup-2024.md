I finally decided my planner and notebook setup for 2024. I will use a Hobonichi Weeks as I do since 2016. I decided to go for the Mega, it is slightly thicker than the standard one. [[It is just 3mm thicker  than the standard Weeks ![Weeks Mega](/assets/postimg/weeks-mega.jpg) but offers more than 200 pages at the end for free writings, like having an additional notebook::rmn]]. For daily journaling I normally use an A5 notebook, this year I have decided to go with the Hobonichi Weeks memo pad. They're 40 pages and made of the same Tomoe River paper the Weeks is done with. I will carry everything into an undyed Leather Slim cover from Galen Leather.

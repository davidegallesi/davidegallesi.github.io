[Matt Salinger: ‘My father was writing for 50 years without publishing. That’s a lot of material’](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/01/matt-salinger-jd-the-catcher-in-the-rye)

> What becomes clear is that he has been immersed in his father’s material for years – pages typed on Underwood and Royal typewriters, as well as what Salinger called “his squibs, or his fragments” on ordinary paper cut into eighths: “a lot of handwritten, very small notes”. When he began work in 2011, Matt never expected it would take eight years.

*A lot of handwritten, very small notes*, music to the ears of an analog writer like me.

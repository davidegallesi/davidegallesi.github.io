Hello, my name is Davide Gallesi I live in [Milano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan), Italy. It’s spring (I love spring) and this is what I’m doing now.

- Wearing a mask.
- Loving and living my family.
- Working with passion to grow my (really) [small company](http://www.nexo.me/).
- Reading.
- Walking.
- Biking.
- Writing on paper with fountain pens and pencils.
- Fighting daily against my ignorance.
- Slowing down.
- Sharing (rarely) short thoughts, photos, quotes [here](https://www.twitter.com/davidegallesi).

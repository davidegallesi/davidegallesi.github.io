- Loving my family, I'm a family guy.
- Reading, writing, walking and biking.
- Renovating my 37 years old bicycle, [here]( {{ siteurl }} ) the project journal (when ready).
- Searching the right balance between analog and digital.
- Writing with fountain pens and trying to improve my handwriting.
- Working hard to grow my really [small business](http://www.nexo.me).
- Committed to be everyday a little bit less ignorant.

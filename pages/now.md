Hello, my name is Davide Gallesi and this is what I'm doing now.
<br>
- Living in [Milano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan){:target="_blank"}, Italy. It's autumn now.
- Loving and living my family.
- Working with passion to grow my (really) [small company](http://www.nexo.me){:target="_blank" class="nexo"}.
- [Reading](/tsundoku).
- Walking.
- Biking.
- Writing on paper with fountain pens.
- Fighting daily with my ignorance.
- Slowing down.
- Sharing (rarely) short thoughts, photos, quotes [here](https://www.twitter.com/davidegallesi){:target="_blank" class="twitter"}.

The **/now** page movement has been inspired by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/nowff){:target="_blank"}.

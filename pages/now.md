My name is [Davide Gallesi](https://twitter.com/davidegallesi) and this is what I'm doing now.

    font-size: $body-font-size;
    line-height: 1;
  } 
</style>


- Loving and living my family.
- Reading, writing, walking and biking.
- Renovating my 37 years old bicycle.
- Searching the right balance between analog and digital.
- Writing with fountain pens and paper trying to improve my penmanship.
- Working hard to grow my really [small business](http://www.nexo.me).
- Committed to be everyday a little bit less ignorant.

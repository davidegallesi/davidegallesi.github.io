<blockquote>
  <p>What becomes clear is that he has been immersed in his fatherâ€™s material for years â€“ pages typed on Underwood and Royal typewriters, as well as what Salinger called â€œhis squibs, or his fragmentsâ€ on ordinary paper cut into eighths: â€œa lot of handwritten, very small notesâ€. When he began work in 2011, Matt never expected it would take eight years.</p>

<p><em>A lot of handwritten, very small notes</em>, music to the ears of an analog writer like me.</p>

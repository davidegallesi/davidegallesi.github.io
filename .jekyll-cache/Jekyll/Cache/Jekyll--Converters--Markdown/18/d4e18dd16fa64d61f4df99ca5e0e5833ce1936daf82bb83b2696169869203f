  <p>I began to see it wasnâ€™t newspapers that were so great, but social media that was so badâ€¦ The built-in incentives on Twitter and Facebook reward speed over depth, hot takes over facts and seasoned propagandists over well-meaning analyzers of news.
You donâ€™t have to read a print newspaper to get a better relationship with the news. But, for goodnessâ€™ sake, please stop getting your news mainly from Twitter and Facebook.</p>

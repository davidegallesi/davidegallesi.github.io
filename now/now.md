## /now

Hello, my name is Davide Gallesi I live in [Milano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan){:target="_blank"}, Italy. It's spring now and were all still in lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is what I'm doing now.
<br>
· Loving and living my family.

· Working with passion to grow my (really) [small company](http://www.nexo.me){:target="_blank" class="nexo"}.

· [Reading](/tsundoku).

· Walking.

· Biking.

· Writing on paper with fountain pens.

· Fighting daily against my ignorance.

· Slowing down.

· Sharing (rarely) short thoughts, photos, quotes [here](https://www.twitter.com/davidegallesi){:target="_blank" class="twitter"}.

<br>

<small>The **/now** page movement has been inspired by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/nowff){:target="_blank"}.
